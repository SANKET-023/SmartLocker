### Project Overview

The **Smart Locker System** provides a secure, user-friendly authentication mechanism through facial recognition. The system ensures only legitimate users can access the locker through:

- **Biometric Authentication**: Facial recognition using `dlib`.
- **Anti-Spoofing**: Eye-blinking detection to avoid photo-based impersonation.
- **Document Verification**: OCR for PAN card for identity confirmation during registration.

### Features

1. **Biometric Access with Facial Recognition**: Each user can securely unlock the locker using facial recognition, eliminating the need for keys or passwords.
2. **Anti-Spoofing Mechanism**: Incorporates real-time eye-blink detection to avoid attempts to unlock the system using photos or videos.
3. **PAN Card OCR for Registration**: During the registration process, the system verifies the user’s identity by scanning and recognizing their PAN card details.
4. **Secure Backend**: Uses Flask for API management and MongoDB for user data storage.

### System Requirements

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Flask**
- **MongoDB**
- **dlib**
- **OpenCV**
- **Tesseract OCR** (for PAN card OCR)

#### Hardware Requirements
- A webcam for facial recognition.
- Sufficient processing power for facial recognition (16GB RAM recommended).

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-locker.git
   cd smart-locker
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up MongoDB**:
   - Install MongoDB and start the MongoDB service.
   - Create a database named `smart_locker` with a collection named `users`.

4. **Set Up Flask**:
   - Configure environment variables in the `.env` file for MongoDB URI and Flask secret key.
   
5. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

6. **Ensure Webcam Permissions**: Allow webcam access for facial recognition.

### Usage

1. **User Registration**:
   - Access the registration page on the local server.
   - Submit a PAN card image for OCR verification.
   - Complete face registration through webcam input, ensuring proper lighting for accurate detection.
  
2. **Locker Access**:
   - On the access page, use the webcam for facial recognition.
   - Perform the eye-blink detection to complete authentication.

### Security Implications

The Smart Locker System enhances security through advanced biometric authentication. However, it’s essential to consider:

1. **Data Privacy**: Facial data and personal information (e.g., PAN card details) are stored securely in MongoDB. Encrypt this data to comply with data privacy regulations like GDPR.
2. **Spoofing Prevention**: Eye-blink detection mitigates risks of spoofing but may need periodic updates as new methods of spoofing emerge.
3. **Access Control**: Only authorized users should have access to the backend, particularly the user data and facial images stored in the MongoDB database.

### Ethical Implications

While biometric systems improve security, they also raise ethical concerns:

1. **Privacy Concerns**: Storing and processing facial data could compromise user privacy if not handled responsibly. Users must be informed about data collection, storage, and usage practices.
2. **Bias in Facial Recognition**: Certain demographic groups may experience lower accuracy in recognition, depending on training data quality. Regular accuracy testing and retraining with diverse data can reduce bias.
3. **Informed Consent**: Users should be fully informed about how their biometric data is stored and used. Consent must be obtained during the registration process.
